# Sorting-visuals
A C++ application to implement a visual representation of sorting algorithms 
Description: Used a graphics library (like graphics.h) to show the real-time sorting of randomly generated numbers. Generated random numbers of sample space (say 100 numbers) and performed sorting using different sorting algorithms. (namely quicksort, mergesort, insertionsort, selection sort)
